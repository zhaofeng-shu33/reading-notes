# First Coursework of Behavior Social Science
2015/7/12

Read the following from “Thinking, Fast and Slow”: Introduction and Chapters 1-3.

Answer the following questions:

1. After you finish reading Introduction, close the book and write down what you remember the most from your reading. Do you think your answer is subject to some kinds of heuristic bias? Explain. (If you do not remember anything, you still need to answer the second part.)


What I remember the most from the reading after reading Introduction Part is about the new Tendency in behavioral Science. Kahnemann and his colleague Tversky put their emphasis on the human bias in the process of decision-making. This is an unexplored area before their influential research and has wide application, far beyond their expert domain--psychology. In retrospect, their findings were inspiring. In the rapid-pace modern society, citizens have to concentrate on more important matters so that they react to countless trivial decision-requiring situations according to their System 1. Or in other word, they choose a energy-saving way to think fast. However, such an intuition-relying method is not always reliable and sometimes lead to common errors. One example is that we make decisions with the help of intuition without   considering the statistical figures. We think of specialty first and ignored many more other factors. By analyzing these common fallacies in our choice or decision making process, terms are introduced and we can better conduct our lives by first recognizing these errors. This is my main gain from reading Introduction Part of this book. 



2. After you finish reading Introduction, close the book and answer in your own wo-rds. What do System1 and System 2 do? When reading Chapter 1, do you engage both systems? Wh-ere and how?

Human mainly uses two systems to handle extra information. One is through System 1, which reacts to extra information immediately in an instinct way. The Other is through System 2, which gave slow reaction because of the thinking process. 
To handle routine business, System 1 is enough. Only with respect to dealing with intellectual activities do I need the involvement of System 2. When System 2 works, it need stimuli from outside, and after a complex process of analyzing the given signal, System 2 gave suggestions on how to react. 


3. Personally I do not like Chapter 2 as I think it disrupts the flow of my reading. What do you think Chapter 2 wants to achieve? Do you agree with my assessment? Why o-r why not?

Chapter Two, titled “Attention and Effort”, describes in detail the “Add One” Experience and the accompanied nuance of body changes when people are using their System 2 to solve problems. It also emphasized the blindness effect when System 2 of people is fully involved. It should be noticed that The Author says in the Introduction Part that System 1 is the protagonist in this book. But he tells the story of System 2 in this Chapter. Perhaps the reading flow is interrupted because of this reason. I agree with this opinion. In the following chapter, the Author still treats mainly with the potential of System 2. Only beginning with the 4th Chapter has the Author put main attention to the unknown consciousness in our mind (The Priming Effect).

4. Chapter 3 is quite controversial to me. I feel the author seems to argue System1 and System 2 are all brains are about. Therefore, all good things are correlated because they are performed by System 2. Comment on my statement using examples from this chapter.

Chapter Three, titled The Lazy Controller, explores the inactiveness of System 2 in most cases. People tend to save their mental energy if possible. The Author cites one psychological experience which explains “Ego Depletion”: When System 2 is highly involved to solve tough problems, the motivation to involve in another tough task is reduced. But relying solely on System 1 can produce bias. That is why smart students make foolish mistakes on very simple questions.  This Chapter also reviews the relation between self-control and intelligence. The famous “Child and Cookie” Experiment is quoted. The difference between different people should be noticed. Such difference may derive from the structure of System 2.  In the “student and simple question” subsection, it seems the author stressed on the implausible aspect of System 1 and gave high appreciation to System 2. Such distinction is partial. And it has been said in the former answer that illustration of System 2 should not be a main topic in this book. To add another personal observation, it was said many outstanding mathematician in history gave wonderful proof of theorems by instinct, not by the “rational System 2”. Only the strictness of proof process needs the involvement of System 2.
