Story 22

> They threw down their rods, and their rods became snakes, or seemed to. They may have been tame snakes, which they had hidden under their long garments, and then brought out, as if they had been rods.

致命魔术这部电影里充满了这种小把戏。但 Moses 的
rod 和 snake 相互转化的神迹在信徒眼里是真的。

Story 23

> Every family was bidden to find a lamb and to kill it. They were to take some of the blood of the lamb and sprinkle it at the entrance of the house, on the door-frame overhead, and on each side. 

在《了凡四训》中有个类似的故事

> 凡不附贼者，密授以白布小旗，约兵至日，插旗门首，戒军兵无妄杀，全活万人

可见在门上做标记区分我族类和非我族类东西方同之。
