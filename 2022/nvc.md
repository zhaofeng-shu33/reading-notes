# Non violence communication
This is a book for mental cure. I really appreciate the one who recommended this to me.
Different from the approach of traditional psychoanalysis, the author advocates
establishing empathy between people to satisfy mutual needs.
In order to do so, we split observation from judgement, express how we feel instead of analysis,
tell others what we need and finally make requests to fulfill our need.
When others tell something to us, we could reflect back their feelings and put ourselves in their shoes without
heading to solutions too quickly.
