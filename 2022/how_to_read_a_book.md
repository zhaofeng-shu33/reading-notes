## My thoughts after reading "How to read a book"

I think the style of this book can be divided into two distinct elements, the general arguments and the examples.
I prefer the latter element to the former because it gives me a quick glance of the famous books in each genre in the western tradition.

For example, The author suggests to read a novel as quickly as possible.
At the beginning the reader may be overwhelmed by new things and persons,
but soon he will be familiarized with the background and focus on the protagonists.
The suggestion is similar for the genre of lyric poetry. The readers are encouraged
to read aloud and continuously to the end.
For the novel, there are plots and characters, the author is like a god when they make a story.
They apply justice to the characters they create in their book.

When talking about the concept of history, the author uses the analogy on the process of jury.
Even jury cannot ascertain some facts happening recently.
It reminds me of a movie called “twelve angry man”, in which a jury consisting of twelve gentleman changed their mind in a case after a violent debate.
It illustrates the reliability of historical records. In addition,
the author tells us in order to approach the truth about a historical event, we need to read different books on the same topic, which are written from different perspectives.

What the author emphasizes, when talking about the general rules on reading scientific literature, is the focus on scientific classic and modern popularization.
Indeed, these two sub genres are the remaining area where general readers can understand with relatively less efforts.
When the division of subjects is not so serious in the past, intellectuals can understand what scientists say in their treatises.
But nowadays, specialists write something disregarding general readers.
Taking the example of a book titled as “Computational Linguistics” as an example.
This is not a book oriented for general reader but a textbook for post-graduate students with related major.
Therefore, it assumes that you have basic knowledge in statistics and linguistics.
Besides,  its narrative style is quite boring, which is shared by many other engineering textbooks because they convey more knowledge than insights.
However, I think such textbook on tech-humanity is less harder to read than those traditional engineering handbooks since it’s object of study arises curiosity of readers and it does not employ too much math.

Finally, The author categorizes philosophy into theoretical one and practical one.
For the former, it can be further divided into metaphysics, philosophy of nature and epistemology while for the latter it consists of ethnics and political philosophy.
