This is a romantic novel for young adult.
Connell and Marianne are intimate friends in a sense of "green plums and hobby-horse".
In the third chapter, the protagonist Connell made a decision of his future college. He
has two choices, one is learning law at Galway. Another is learning English language and literature at Trinity (College).
For the first choice, its career is prospective. Besides, he has friends at Galway. If he went to college there,
he could have a good social group. He could get a good degree and have a nice new girlfriend probably.
Maybe the sole reason for the latter choice is to be together with Marianne, who preferred to study there for a different major.

Connell recommended Marianne the book, "The Communist Manifesto". I wondered whether it is related with their German class.
