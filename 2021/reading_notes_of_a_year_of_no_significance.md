Before I fell asleep, the possible figure of her
lingered in my mind.
When I woke up, I thought of her.
I didn’t have stomach because of dwelling on her makes me full.
When I finished a tiny breakfast, the rail became heavy while I did not take the umbrella.
In the book of “1587, a year of no significance”,
the author mentioned the boring morning meeting, which was a routine hold every day.
The emperor must attend without special excuses. I think restrictions on the emperor were so many that he must feel constrained
and longing for spending his life as an ordinary person.
The compiled book 明神宗实录 exists today and enables the historian to recover vividly the daily life of the emperor Wanli.
The author thinks the thrift behavior of the emperor is nothing compared with the huge expense of keeping the maintenance of the
while imperial city.

## First Chapter
The author Ray Huang emphasized the literacy level of top eunuchs in late Ming Dynasty.

According to the moral tradition, the person should return to his rural village
to fulfill the last filial piety on the funeral of his father. Such historical
tradition passed to the modern society.

The narrative in the first chapter composes of loosely connected historical
events in the timeline before the year 1587, a western chronological method.

Many officials opposed to the decision of keeping Zhang Juzheng in position during
his mourning time. However, these officials were punished with some excuses
of defying the throne. It is unknown whether these punishment came from the mind of Wanli
emperor himself. Ray Huang believed that the emperor may not remember clearly
how his power was utilized by the trusted group when he was young.

Why Emperor Wanli loved Lady Zheng for so many years？ While Ray Huang argued for the
impossibility of long-time ecstasy in love for a single woman in imperial house,
he also guessed that the attraction of Lady Zheng for Wanli may not be physical.
It may come from the emotional security she gave him and the shared hobby.

Zhang Juzheng was not a perfect figure, especially in his private life. His imperfection
was enlarged soon after his death, and it caused the anger and sadness of Wanli Emperor.

After the death of Zhang JuZheng, all kinds of shadow attacks made Wanli Emperor
disbelieve the hear of Zhang.

## Second chapter
看申时行那一章，感觉有点明末党争的影子，士大夫之间也在明争暗斗，摆出先冠冕堂皇的理由，却全无益于国事。
