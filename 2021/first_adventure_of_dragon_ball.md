# The first adventure of Dragon Ball
Son Goku is the main character of this anime.
This name comes from the "Journey to the West".
There is indeed traces between plot similarity
between the first adventure of Dragon Ball
and that of the journey to the West.
Goku is money-like. His companion Bulma
is human, which matches Tan Sanzang.
Oolong, whose figure is like a pig, indeed
matches the Zhu Bajie. Both of the two
have desire for beautiful girls.
