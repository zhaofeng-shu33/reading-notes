# A Child's History of England
## Chapter 8
It is mentioned in the book that after dying of the Norman Conqueror, his
servants contested for personal profit instead of looking after his body.
"the body of the King, in the indecent strife, was rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for hours, upon the ground." It reminds me of similar situation in Chinese history. When the Duke Huan of Qi died,
his sons also did not care for his burial but contested for the throne.
