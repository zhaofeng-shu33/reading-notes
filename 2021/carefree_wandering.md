# Carefree Wandering
2021/10/16

I attended a reading group about Zhuangzi. This time
we focus on the literature of “Carefree Wandering”, which
is the first chapter of Zhuangzi. Both the literal and the implicit meanings
are explained carefully by the club master of Chinese Classics.
The essence can be summarized as 1. the debate between
the big and small 2. the usefulness of the useless (in Chinese, 小大之辩 and
无用之用)
