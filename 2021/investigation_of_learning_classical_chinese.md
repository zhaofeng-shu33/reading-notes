Due to my devotion in learning Latin and Sanskrit, I have some
new understanding of the classical Chinese. As a native speaker of Chinese mandarin,
I received extensive education of classical Chinese from 6th grade of primary school until 12th grade in high school. The first text I learned was an extract from Mencius, telling a story of playing chess of two children. Even the first article has over 100 characters, which is formidable for beginners. But due to the popular way of classical Chinese education in my pre-university education, which is
rot memorization, we don't need to understand before recitation. After I keep the essay by heart,
I find I can understand it naturally. But it actually needs an accumulation of long time.
The teaching of classical Chinese (including classical poetry) is an integral part of Chinese course, which occupies up to one third
time of the class hours approximately. Plus the countless homework and exercises, the orthodox education
enables every educated Chinese to be enable to read in classical Chinese after the graduation of high school. The time span is about 7 years.

As I emphasize above, the recitation is the key to learn classical Chinese. every essay needs to be recited until high school, when some historical extracts
become too long to be memoized. Still, these long articles need to be read fluently.
My Chinese teacher would come out of two ways to check the students: one is to recite aloud in front of
other students, the other is to write the text down by heart. For the latter approach, the
Chinese characters can also be checked. Since Chinese is polyphonic, it is error-prune to write the wrong
character if the student does not understand the meaning of the sentences.
A routine in my K12 education is called morning reading, and a considerable time is used to memorize
the classical Chinese texts. In the college entrance examination, classical Chinese takes about 40 scores
while the full score is 150.

In Chinese, there are few to be said about the grammar of nouns and verbs while the flexibility of conjugations and prepositions become the core grammar to be studied. We call the part the usage of
functional word (虚词). During my junior education, every functional word in an essay in Chinese class.
It may depend on the Chinese teacher. We need to divide the meaning of the word into several categories
and judge which category the specific word within a context belongs to.
Sometimes there is ambiguity for doing so.

Another important learning method is translation, which is also the questions we surely encountered in examination. The translation is from classical Chinese to modern Chinese. Usually we could get the full translation of every essay, and we need to make sure we can master the translation. Interestingly,
I seldom use the translation to help me understand the original text. As I said above, recitation makes
me understand the original text. By the way, the method of translation is also common in the courses
of Sanskrit and Latin I take in university.
