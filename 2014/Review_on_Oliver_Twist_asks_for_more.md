# Review on “Oliver Twist asks for more”
2014/8/16

Dear Paula:

Anyway I can not resist myself writing something to share with others. I was a little disappointed at no reply. Maybe you could just share with me your reading reaction or something else.

I try to use simple English to make me understood. But I have to admit my poor English writing without systematic training.

According to plan, my major study is finished around half by now. But only recently have I vacated some time to read English literature---merely the essays or novels I have longed to read for a long time. Intermittently I finally finished the reading of a long essay about conditions of English female writers. I began to read it from late June but often the process was continuously broken by other study tasks. But it was not the important thing I want to talk about.

Do you still remember the English text we have learned about “Oliver Twist” in high school? 

Maybe you read the whole book in childhood. The author is very outstanding English novelist---Charles Dickens. As I learned from my Western Literature Class last semester, he was popular even at his time, when he wrote for magazines and held many reading activities to raise money for poor people. Actually this novel was originally published at a magazine in a form of installment. I found the mark at the end of our text (the editor absolutely omitted it ). After the gentleman in white clothes predicted O T would be hung. Dickens said he could not hint the life of O T just now and if he did so, he would ruin the following narrative. But I have to admit the sentence made by Dickens was sometimes so long that I made every efforts trying to understanding it. This happens when he came onto the stage and described characters indirectly. When he went backstage and the dialog and action of story flowed, the language was quiet simple expect for some raw words, which has been deleted from our text.

The reason why I can find the original text lies in it appears at Chapter Two, before the text, the board of the workhouse made cruel regulations. They thought the poor people liked the workhouse very much because it provided food, shelter for them without their payment.  “We’ll stop it all, in no time” they said angrily.

After the new regulation was in full operation, many poor people died. Those left was wasted and shrank a lot because of scant food. Thus the population of workhouse decreased sharply, which pleased the board a lot.

So we have the story of our text. Perhaps the editor only substitutes some literary words for common words. Some sentence structure in the original text was nearly similar to our text, such as ”Child as Oliver Twist was, he was desperate with hunger…” Chapter Two ended with the prediction of the gentleman mentioned above. Then I looked a little at Chapter Three. O T seemed to stay at “prison” for some time then was taken by a worker, who swept chimney.

I stopped for a while to think the particular prominence of this novel even though I only heard of and read a little. Then my shallow thoughts came. How many installment stories went extinct from people’s eyes from Dicken’s era to now! I thought story of Oliver was not so particular without combination of satiric and splendid language. Even in his description of the board, we can see a little of his language characteristics.

When they heard OT asked for more porridge, the header of the board behaves as follows (you can refer to your text):

‘For more!?’ said Mr. Limbkins. ‘Compose yourself, Bumble (the message sender, who was also astonished by OT), and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary.”

If we can read the part according to roles, that will be interesting enough. But it was a pity that our high English class did not provide such chance. But choosing to listen to audio-book of this paragraph was a second chance. (PS: I think online free-charge audio-book resources have been paralyzed by the same type commercial resources. Some web-pages can hardly be opened.)

Return to the text itself. It showed the doubt of the header without reservation. He was too proud of his regulation to believe a nine-year old OT broke it by saying such counter-? Sentence. It was also interesting to compare the text with 范進中舉, in which some figures have been described similarly.

If I have some prejudice, it lies in the popularity of novels of Charles Dickens in China. Official commentators talked much about his revealing the black old society… Actually his novel was set in the boosting of Great Britain, often called “Victoria Era”, in which many realistic novels were born. Social Problems accompanied with rapid development, which was also true in current China. But in Dicken’s time, his sharp-pointed novel in some extent pushed the reform of governmental policy. So it was fair to say Dickens as a humanitarian instead of a revolutionist. In his belief, a good government or a couple of good rich men can solve all social problems without the overthrown of the present political structure. This conclusion, which came from a review written by George Orwell (author of Animal Farm) (introduced to us by my Western Literature Professor), was totally different to those of our commentators. But probably I have no qualification to quote his opinion without reading totally his review (that must be based on profound knowledge of Dickens’ novels, maybe the sequence of reading books comes naturally from such feelings).

It was because we once had two class hour to read a novel chapter written by Dickens that I talked a little more about my experience. On the middle-term exam, his scenery depiction paragraph was for us to analyze. As you can imagine, that kind of scenery depiction (which was full of fog) is different from that of 朱自清, if you allow me to translate what I thought about the literary effect into Chinese, I have nothing to say but,用來“黑”他馬上要寫的“法院”.

So much have I typed. I only hope you may not feel overwhelmed by my bad English writing.

Your free wind
