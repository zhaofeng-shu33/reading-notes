# 《牛虻讀書筆記》
2014/2/14

小說《牛虻》以神甫與少年亞瑟的對話開篇，提到亞瑟在母親過世后的思想轉變，在周圍一些同學的影響下，有了投身革命事業的想法。然而這讓神甫蒙泰尼里很擔憂，他把亞瑟看作自己的孩子，深知革命要冒很大的風險。

然而蒙泰里尼仍考慮把亞瑟從那條危險的道路上拉回來，在和神甫去度假時，比起風光旖旎的湖泊，亞瑟更喜歡湍急而下、灰暗渾濁的奧爾韋河，

No revolution peacefully succeeds, which case is inconsistent with the bloodshed described in the novel” Gadfly”.

The protagonist, Arthur, or Gadfly, for his ideal of Italy, dies gallantly at the shot of carabineers. It is strange that those low-stated watchmen at prisons show much empathy towards him. For his persistence, for his sufferings? Even when he is executed to death, those carabineers tilt their carbines involuntarily.

Arthur is an atheist. Early in his youth, after the lie of Montanelli is betrayed, and after his struggle in South America, he becomes a radical and disgusts at those about Jesus. It is his belief which contradicts with Montanelli’s, that both sides can never agree on their political attitudes before the death of the former. The author, Voynich, describes in detail the sorrow of Montanelli after Arthur’s death. It seems that the Padre finally betrays his religious beliefs and comes to his end of life.

The female leading character, Gemma, also plays an essential role in the development of plots. It is unexplainable that she is fascinated by Gadfly and determined to join his radical plan against the government. She is a sheer contrast to the gipsy girl, Zita, who concerns only herself though she loves Gadfly. Gemma shares common beliefs with her comrades and burdens much in the process of assignments.

Montanelli, reverenced as “ Your Eminence” by people, can never part with the shadow of his son, Gadfly. It is like a blot in his heart, and he at end pays the debt with his life.

The novel inspires me to seek the answer: Which roads should adolescence choose ?
