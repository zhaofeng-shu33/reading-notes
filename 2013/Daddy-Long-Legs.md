## Introduction of Daddy-Long-Legs

This is a obscure love novel by American writer, Jean Webster. It gives account of the experience of a girl called Jerusha out of asylum. She was subsidized by a mysterious trustee called Daddy-Long-Legs by Jerusha. she finished  four-year undergraduate education successfully. During her summer vacation, she spends a wonderful time with Jervis, uncle of one of her roommate. It doesn’t turn out that Jervis is the same person with Daddy-Long-Legs. And Jerusha finally shows her love to Jervis.

The form of the book only applies letters from Jerusha to Jervis. By making account of details of life and passionate love, it expresses an attitude to live freely and independently. Especially, to “drop a kiss on those lips sternly” (Brontë,1847, Chapter 37).  It coincides with value of Americans.

## Assessment and evaluation

Doubtlessly, the genre of Daddy-Long-Legs is similar to Jane Eyre (Charlotte Brontë,1847). The hero hides some important facts towards the heroin, and makes detours to get together with the heroin when he is physically damaged. Both the two books reflect the influence of traditional family status on marriage. Both writers use a large number of sensational descriptions, reflecting the complex inner activity of the heroin.

However, Daddy-Long-Legs has unique features. It seems to depict much more of the university life of Jerusha and successfully put the main theme of the book backstage. It includes many aspects of university life like clothes, gymnasium etc. It uses simple and figurative words and sentences to illustrate complex philosophy.

In my view, Daddy-Long-Legs also has shortcomings. Readers can conjecture already the same identify of Daddy and Jervis. When showing Jerusha’s mental activities, many metaphors are not elegant, thus degrading the virtue of Jerusha. For example, the author uses the echoing and common way to describe how Jerusha feels when she misses Jervis:

The whole world seems empty and aching. I hate the moonlight because it’s beautiful and he isn’t here to see it with me. (p.230)

The same to describe the mental missing feeling, Lin Yutang uses a different and impressing way:

It was at school that Mulan discovered what separation meant…When spring came she was seized with a strong and sad longing to see Lifu, to talk with him, and hear his voice again. In the company of the flowers in the morning or of the moon at night, reading before the window or walking in the school garden at dusk, she could not brush from her mind the image of Lifu’s face. (p.289)

In the above quotation, Mulan is contrasted with the cheerful flowers and bright moons.

Meantime elegant words and symmetric sentences are used. By comparison Daddy-Long-Legs
are too narrative and less literary.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Daddy-Long-Legs is a popular, interesting novel rather than a classical novel. On one hand, it reflects illusion of modern girls, who desire to marry well without diligence. On the other, it conveys many positive energy of life like “Whatever sky’s above me, I’ve a heart for any fate.”(p.214) As a reader, we need to choose our own tendency.
