My hometown is located not far from birthplace of Confucius. It nurtured another philosophy, Mozi in about 2000 years ago. Besides its cultural influence, it was well-known for a kind of fruit, pomegranate , which sells all over China. In recent history , my hometown was ruined by Japanese invaders but in the 21st century , my hometown went into a period of rapid development. Rows of buildings are being erected and a large square is playing a more important role in people’s life. As for food,
Mutton Soup and Pancakes Containing Vegetables are two local delicacies. People here are friendly to visitors.
