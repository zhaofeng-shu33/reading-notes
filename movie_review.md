# Darkest hour
Winston Churchill is an optimist.
In his time of skepticism about his strategy to support the fight,
he was encouraged by both the British king and the common people.
It reminds me of my reading and listening of his speech almost ten years ago
when I was studying for my college entrance examination.
It was a period of dark hour in my life. But as Churchill says,
« Je n'ai à offrir que du sang, du labeur, des larmes et de la sueur »
